Making sure you fully understand the work is more important than rushing to complete as many cards as possible because understanding the material allows for deeper learning and it ensures long term mastery and application of knowledge and that is one of the skill a web developer should have because web development is a field that requires not just surface-level knowledge, but a deep understanding of programming languages, frameworks, and best practices.
Rushing through to complete tasks without comprehension can lead to buggy code, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient solutions.
